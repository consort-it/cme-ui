This library exists because at the time of writing the compiled aws-amplify-angular (0.3.3) library provided on npm
did not work when integrated in a Angular Typescript project.

We extracted the code of the library, fixed the worst typing errors and compile it ourselves now.

Maybe the aws-amplify-angular library has evolved now and you can directly use the version provided on npm? Give it a try...
